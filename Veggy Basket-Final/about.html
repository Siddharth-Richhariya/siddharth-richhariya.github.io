                    Vegetable, in the broadest sense, any kind of plant life or plant product, namely “vegetable
                    matter”; in common, narrow usage, the term vegetable usually refers to the fresh edible portions of
                    certain herbaceous plants—roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruit, or seeds. These plant parts are
                    either eaten fresh or prepared in a number of ways, usually as a savory, rather than sweet, dish.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Virtually all of the more important vegetables were cultivated among the ancient civilizations of
                    either the Old or the New World and have long been noted for their nutritional importance. Most
                    fresh vegetables are low in calories and have a water content in excess of 70 percent, with only
                    about 3.5 percent protein and less than 1 percent fat. Vegetables are good sources of minerals,
                    especially calcium and iron, and vitamins, principally A and C. Nearly all vegetables are rich in
                    dietary fibre and antioxidants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Modern vegetable farming ranges from small-scale production for local sale to vast commercial
                    operations utilizing the latest advances in automation and technology. In addition, vegetables can
                    be grown conventionally or using organic farming methods. Most vegetables are planted by seeding in
                    the fields where they are to be grown, but occasionally they are germinated in a nursery or
                    greenhouse and transplanted as seedlings to the field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the growing season synthetic or organic herbicides, pesticides, and fungicides are commonly
                    used to inhibit damage by weeds, insects, and diseases, respectively. Depending on the crop,
                    harvesting operations are usually mechanized in well-developed countries, but the practice of
                    harvesting by hand is still employed in some areas or is used in conjunction with machine
                    operations. Another concern of the vegetable farmer is post-harvest storage, which may require
                    refrigerated facilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vegetables may be washed, sorted, graded, cut, and packaged for sale as fresh products. Fresh
                    vegetables are subject to quick aging and spoilage, but their storage life can be extended by such
                    preservation processes as dehydration, canning, freezing, fermenting, or pickling.
